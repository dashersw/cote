cote
====

cote is an auto-discovery mesh network framework for building fault-tolerant and scalable applications. It hosts components that let you write programs that discover each other over a private network and communicate in various schemes.

Join us on [![cote Slack](http://slack.cotejs.org/badge.svg)](http://slack.cotejs.org) for anything related to cote.

Develop your first microservices in under two minutes:
----
in `time-service.js`...
```js
var cote = require('cote');
var timeService = new cote.Responder({name: 'Time Service'});

timeService.on('time', (req, cb) => {
    cb(new Date());
});
```

in `client.js`...
```js
var cote = require('cote');
var client = new cote.Requester({name: 'Client'});

client.on('ready', () => {
    client.send({type: 'time'}, (time) => {
        console.log(time);
    });
});
```

That's all! Wasn't that simple? Now you can scale linearly on tens of machines. No configuration, no third party components, no nginx, no kafka, no consul and **only** Node.js. cote.js is batteries and chargers included!

Microservices case study

Motivation
----

Tomorrow belongs to distributed software. As CPU performance is heavily dictated by the number of cores and the power of each core is already at its limits, distributed computing will decide how your application performs. Distributed systems also pose great architectural benefits such as fault-tolerance and scalability.

Components of such a distributed system should be able to find other components <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_configuration_networking">zeroconf</a> and communicate over a set of conventions. Sometimes they may work as a cluster, may include a pub/sub mechanism, or a request/response mechanism. Cote brings you the advantages of distributed software. Think of it like homing pigeons.

Installing
----

* via npm<br>
`npm install cote`
* via git<br>
`git clone git://github.com/dashersw/cote.git`

Components
----

All components support namespaces. Given as the configuration object to the constructor, components adhere and act on namespaces if provided, and ignore other messages.

### Requester

Requester queues requests until a Responder is available, and once so, it delivers the request. Requests will be dispatched to Responders in a round-robin way.

Example:
```js
var Requester = require('cote').Requester;

var randomRequest = new Requester({
    name: 'randomReq',
    // namespace: 'rnd',
    requests: ['randomRequest']
});

randomRequest.on('ready', function() {
    setInterval(function() {
        var req = {
            type: 'randomRequest',
            val: ~~(Math.random() * 10)
        };

        randomRequest.send(req, function(res) {
            console.log('request', req, 'answer', res);
        });
    }, 5000);
});
```

### Responder

Responder is a component for responding to certain requests from a Requester. It's a descendant of EventEmitter2, and requests are regular events, therefore may be wildcarded or namespaced.

Responder may be used to add new modules to existing web servers / applications without ever changing the main server code. Only a Requester will be able to utilize a Responder.

Example:
```js
var Responder = require('cote').Responder;

// Instantiate a new Responder component.
var randomResponder = new Responder({
    name: 'randomRep',
    // namespace: 'rnd',
    respondsTo: ['randomRequest'] // types of requests this responder
                                  // can respond to.
});

// request handlers are like any event handler.
randomResponder.on('randomRequest', function(req, cb) {
    var answer = ~~(Math.random() * 10);
    console.log('request', req.val, 'answering with', answer);
    cb(answer);
});
```

### Publisher

Publisher is a component for publishing certain events with arbitrary data. It may be used as a distributed EventEmitter. It may also be used in a scenario where some components need to be notified of updates, such as new tweets, etc. instead of polling for them. Only a subscriber will get notifications from a Publisher.

Example:
```js
var Publisher = require('cote').Publisher;

// Instantiate a new Publisher component.
var randomPublisher = new Publisher({
    name: 'randomPub',
    // namespace: 'rnd',
    broadcasts: ['randomUpdate']
});

// Wait for the publisher to find an open port and listen on it.
randomPublisher.on('ready', function() {
    setInterval(function() {
        var val = {
            val: ~~(Math.random() * 1000)
        };

        console.log('emitting', val);

        // publish an event with arbitrary data at any time
        randomPublisher.publish('randomUpdate', val);
    }, 3000);
});
```

### Subscriber

Subscriber subscribes to events emitted from a Publisher.

Example:
```js
var Subscriber = require('cote').Subscriber;

var randomSubscriber = new Subscriber({
    name: 'randomSub',
    // namespace: 'rnd',
    subscribesTo: ['randomUpdate']
});

randomSubscriber.on('randomUpdate', function(req) {
    console.log('notified of ', req);
});
```

### Sockend

Sockend is the glue for carrying all the possibilities of cote to the next level with WebSockets over socket.io. Sockend makes Responders and Publishers available to the front-end and adhere to socket.io namespaces. It's the magic for distributed web apps.

Example:
`index.html`
```html
<script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>
<script>
  var socket = io.connect('http://localhost:5555');
  var socket2 = io.connect('http://localhost:5555/rnd');

  setInterval(function() {
    var req = {
      val: ~~(Math.random() * 10)
    };

    var req2 = {
      val: ~~(Math.random() * 10)
    };

    socket.emit('randomRequest', req, function(data) {
      console.log('normal', req.val, data);
    });

    socket2.emit('randomRequest', req2, function(data) {
      console.log('ns', req2.val, data);
    });
  }, 3000)

</script>
```
`sockend.js`
```js
var app = require('http').createServer(handler)
  , io = require('socket.io').listen(app)
  , fs = require('fs')

app.listen(5555);

function handler (req, res) {
  fs.readFile(__dirname + '/index.html',
  function (err, data) {
    if (err) {
      res.writeHead(500);
      return res.end('Error loading index.html');
    }

    res.writeHead(200);
    res.end(data);
  });
};

var sockend = new require('../../').Sockend(io, {
  name: 'sockend'
});
```

Now, fire up a few Responders and Publishers on default or 'rnd' namespace and watch them glow with magic on `http://localhost:5555`.

### Monitor

Monitor is the "top" of cote. It lists all the daemons it discovers regardless of namespace or key. Run `examples/monitor.js` and see all your active cote daemons.
